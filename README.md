## SDLC Tab

### Project Phases

As we know, here are some common phases of software development:

- Project Initiation
- Requirements (Analysis)
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

For simplicity, we will focus on the following phases in the application:

- Project Initiation Phase: Project Charter document
- Requirements Phase: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Design Phase: Software Design document (SDD)

Note: There are other documents used in these phases, but we will concentrate on these ones in our App.

### Using SDLC Tab

In this page as shown in the video, you will:

1. **Create Documents:**
   - Click the Create Button.
   - Choose the phase you want to fill its information.

2. **Fill and Validate the Form:**
   - Fill the form of the chosen phase (you will find the form fields in the video).
   - You can’t submit the form if any field is empty.

3. **Edit or Delete Stored Documents:**
   - The submitted form will be stored, and you can view the document information.
   - You can edit or delete this information.

4. **Requirements Phase:**
   - When filling this form, choose an image for your Usecase Diagram.

5. **Design Phase:**
   - The form can include many rows of field groups.
   - Each row has:
     - File name field: will hold the name of the file.
     - Browse image field: which will browse for the file itself (as an image).
   - Each row (file name field and browse image field) will hold a Document.
   - You can add any number of documents from the “Add new Document” button.
   - By clicking this button, you will add a new document.
   - Note: You can’t submit the form if any row has an empty field.

## All Files Tab

In this page, you will see all the files (images) you have entered in the different phases (requirement and design phases).

Files (as images) may be:
- UML Diagrams
- Database Design
- Usecase Diagram
- User Interface (UI) Design

You can tap on the file name, and the file will be displayed.
